**Why use this?**
- Get a quick start when setting up new PCs or VMs.
- Avoid the chaos of disordered and duplicate folders that eventually happens to everyone.
- The snake_case convention is consistent, clear and maximizes compatibility.

**[Download the Filetree Blueprint](https://github.com/Qwernasivob/simple-filetree-blueprint/releases/download/v1.0/home.zip)**

This is simply a guideline based on a balanced structure I personally find effective. Feel free to modify the structure to suit your needs. For example:
- Add "music/" under "projects/" if you're a producer.
- If games hold a special place for you, make "games/" a primary directory.


## Recommended software/ 💽

Based on my personal preferences and experience, I've listed some essential software too:

- **browsers/**: [Mozilla Firefox 🔓](https://www.mozilla.org)
- **communication/**: [Discord 🆓](https://discord.com/) (there's a web version)
- **development/**: [Visual Studio Code 🆓](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Git 🔓](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **file_management/**: [Everything 🆓](https://www.voidtools.com/es-es/), [WizTree 🆓](https://diskanalyzer.com/)
- **file_sharing/**: [qBittorrent 🔓](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download) (please for the love of me, don't use uTorrent or BitTorrent)
- **file_utilities/**: [7-Zip 🔓](https://www.7-zip.org/), [File Converter 🔓](https://file-converter.org/)
- **games/game_launchers/**: [Steam 🆓](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)
- **multimedia/**: [VLC Media Player 🔓](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.es.html) (versatile, plays essentially anything), [mpv 🔓](https://mpv.io/) (extremely good for HDR content and other content that might require wacky video drivers. If VLC can't play it, this will)
- **system_tools/**: [PowerToys 🔓](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases) (lots of different tools, check the list [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/))

🔓 - Open Source  
🆓 - Freeware

While these are my go-to choices and are primarily for Windows (though many are available for other operating systems, [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/) can help), I encourage you to explore and find what best suits your needs.
